    <h1>IRONMAN</h1>
    <p>
      Iron Man, American comic book superhero, a mainstay of Marvel Comics, who
      first appeared in 1963 in Tales of Suspense no. 39. His creation is
      officially credited to four people: writer and editor Stan Lee, who
      plotted the first story; his brother Larry Lieber, who scripted it; artist
      Don Heck, who drew it; and Jack Kirby, who designed Iron Manâ€™s original
      armoured battlesuit. Iron Man has appeared as the star of his own comic
      book series, as a regular guest in other popular comics (most notably in
      the The Avengers), in animated films and television series, and in
      live-action motion pictures.
