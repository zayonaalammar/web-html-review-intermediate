      Spider-Man, comic-book character who was the original everyman superhero.
      In Spider-Man’s first story, in Marvel Comics’ Amazing Fantasy, no. 15
      (1962), American teenager Peter Parker, a poor sickly orphan, is bitten by
      a radioactive spider. As a result of the bite, he gains superhuman
      strength, speed, and agility along with the ability to cling to walls.
      Writer Stan Lee and illustrator Steve Ditko created Spider-Man as a filler
      story for a canceled anthology series. At the time, a teenage lead hero
      was unheard of in comic books. However, young readers responded powerfully
      to Peter Parker, prompting an ongoing title and, ultimately, a media
      empire, including video games, several animated and one live-action
      television series, a live-action film franchise, and a Broadway musical.
